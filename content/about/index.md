I aspire to become a software engineer at a prominent organization.

Open Source projects and technologies have always intrigued me and have always been my passion. I am always open to new ideas for projects and improvements in them which has helped me build my knowledge in such projects.

# Prominent Projects

  * **Syncope**

As a part of my project for the Google Summer of Code, I took up an issue on the Syncope project by The Apache Software Foundation which involved building a plugin for Eclipse which interfaces with the Syncope deployment to allow users to view and edit Mail and Report Templates.

  * **Voice based query interface for database**

The aim of the project is to develop a system that takes a natural language statement as a voice (audio) input from the user and then convert it into a relevant query for a specific database.

  * **Porting Ubuntu Touch to OnePlus One**

The aim of the project was to develop a working prototype of Ubuntu Touch for the OnePlus One android smartphone. This involved combining and configuring various drivers to work with OnePlus One hardware.[
