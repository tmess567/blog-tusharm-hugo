> Another problem with this approach is the security of the data.

Since we are now asking the user to select the data from his own system, we are essentially giving him access to all the data available. Not only that, he/she could change the data and upload it to the online server without any problems and the data would be saved online forever.

> One possibility is to saveÂ previous versions of the data online up to a certain date (let&#8217;s say 2-3 days) and also save a log of who changed the data and when (log file will be smaller and can be saved for longer).

But even with this solution, the data will be visible to anyone who wants to view it. This isn&#8217;t a problem with the client&#8217;s current use case scenario but might be one later. I will have to come back to this.
