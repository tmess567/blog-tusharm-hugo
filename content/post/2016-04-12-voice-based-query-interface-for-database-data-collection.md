We have collected the data for the application area that we are working on and that is in the field of medical where we will get to know what medicine a person should take and what are its symptoms and in what quantity it should be taken. Such queries can arise in the mind of a patient so we have collected basic queries that a person can ask using our day-to-day language and in this we have taken about 150-200 queries that a person can put up. These are some of the links from where we have collected data related to this thing.

For example, a person can ask how to intake this medicine and for that the different queries can be asked and that is shown below:

> Whether to take it with water, food, or with a special medicine, or at the same time as other medicines.

A person could ask about the side effects a query for that is :

> What are the possible side effects and what do I do if they occur?

Different queries can be asked related to the different medicines and different disease that can occur:

> What will take the horrific anxiety away that has occurred in the last 3 weeks from gabapentin?
> 
> I have Opthalmic PHN and can&#8217;t take a lot of drugs due to reactions. Is there a patch I can use?
